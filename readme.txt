To design the database for the Zen class programme with the mentioned entities, let's break down the relevant tables and their relationships first. 

### Database Design:

1. **Users Table**: 
   This table stores information about the users (students).
   - Columns: `user_id` (Primary Key), `name`, `email`, `dob`, `enrollment_date`

2. **CodeKata Table**:
   This table stores information about users' CodeKata progress, including problems solved.
   - Columns: `codekata_id` (Primary Key), `user_id` (Foreign Key from Users), `problem_id`, `solved_date`

3. **Attendance Table**:
   This table stores attendance records for users.
   - Columns: `attendance_id` (Primary Key), `user_id` (Foreign Key from Users), `date`, `status` (Absent/Present)

4. **Topics Table**:
   This table stores topics being taught.
   - Columns: `topic_id` (Primary Key), `topic_name`, `date` (date when topic was taught)

5. **Tasks Table**:
   This table stores tasks assigned to users, along with their submission status.
   - Columns: `task_id` (Primary Key), `user_id` (Foreign Key from Users), `task_name`, `assigned_date`, `submitted_date`, `status` (Submitted/Not Submitted)

6. **Company Drives Table**:
   This table stores information about the company drives conducted.
   - Columns: `drive_id` (Primary Key), `company_name`, `start_date`, `end_date`

7. **Mentors Table**:
   This table stores information about the mentors.
   - Columns: `mentor_id` (Primary Key), `name`, `email`, `number_of_mentees`

8. **Mentees Table** (Many-to-Many Relationship between Users and Mentors):
   This table stores the relationship between users (mentees) and mentors.
   - Columns: `mentor_id` (Foreign Key from Mentors), `user_id` (Foreign Key from Users)

### Queries Explanation:

1. **Find all the topics and tasks which are taught in the month of October**:
   - To find all the topics and tasks taught in October, we need to filter records based on the `date` or `assigned_date`. We will query the `Topics` table for entries with a `date` in October and the `Tasks` table for those with an `assigned_date` in October.

2. **Find all the company drives which appeared between 15-Oct-2020 and 31-Oct-2020**:
   - For this query, you would filter the `Company Drives` table by the `start_date` and `end_date` columns, looking for records where the dates fall between 15th October and 31st October 2020. You can use a date range condition to retrieve the relevant drives.

3. **Find all the company drives and students who appeared for the placement**:
   - This query involves finding the company drives where students participated. We can assume that there is a relationship between users (students) and drives, possibly in a `participations` table, where we store which users participated in which drives. The query would join `Company Drives` and `Users` tables through this participation relation.

4. **Find the number of problems solved by the user in CodeKata**:
   - To get the number of problems solved by a user, you can count the entries in the `CodeKata` table where the `user_id` matches the user in question. Each entry corresponds to a problem solved, so the count of those entries will give the number of problems solved by the user.

5. **Find all the mentors with mentees' count greater than 15**:
   - To find mentors with more than 15 mentees, we would query the `Mentors` table. This would involve joining the `Mentees` table (which links users with mentors) and filtering mentors based on the count of associated mentees greater than 15.

6. **Find the number of users who are absent and the task is not submitted between 15-Oct-2020 and 31-Oct-2020**:
   - This query combines data from the `Attendance` and `Tasks` tables. You would join both tables on `user_id` and filter:
     - Attendance records where the `status` is "Absent" and the `date` falls between 15th and 31st October 2020.
     - Task records where the `status` is "Not Submitted" and the `assigned_date` falls within the same range.
   - You would count the distinct users who meet both conditions: being absent and not having submitted their task within that date range.

### Relationships and Explanation:
- The **Users** table is central and related to all the other tables.
- A user can have multiple records in **CodeKata**, **Attendance**, and **Tasks**, so these tables will have a foreign key referencing the `user_id`.
- **Mentors** have a one-to-many relationship with **Mentees**. Each mentor can have multiple mentees, and this is stored in the **Mentees** table, linking mentors and users.
- **Company Drives** are related to **Users** through some kind of participation (which might need a table to capture this relationship).
